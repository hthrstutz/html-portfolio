<h1>Best Movies According to Heather</h1>
<h2>My all-time favorite movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>A Walk to Remember</h3>
<p>I love this movie and can watch it over and over again. It's a typical rom-com, but with a twist. Love isn't always happily ever after, but it should always help you grow in ways you might not expect.</p>
<h3>Phantom of the Opera</h3>
<p>Musical meets romance, but with a dark side. I am struck by the way one can love two people at the same time in completely different ways.</p>
<h3>Free Willy</h3>
<p>I adore orcas. In fact, they are my favorite animal and all because of this movie. The intelligence of the animal is demonstrated by the attachment of Willy to Jesse whom was so different from the other humans at the marine park.</p>
